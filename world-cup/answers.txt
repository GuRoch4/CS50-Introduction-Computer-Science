Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
Based on the predictions provided, the team most likely to win the World Cup is Brazil, followed by Belgium and Portugal.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
The number of simulations required to call the predictions "good enough" would depend on the level of accuracy required for the given task.
