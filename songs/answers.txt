The audio aura can be characterized as diverse in terms of music genres, ranging from pop, rap, rock and electronic music. It features energy, valence, danceability with tracks that have different levels. The general aura conveys a mixture of emotions, from excited and energetic feelings to emotional feelings.

One way to help represent the aura and creating playback history: The calculated audio aura does not take into account the listener's playback history. Music preferences and evoked emotions can be influenced by personal playing history, which includes songs the listener has listened to in the past. Therefore, a more representative approach could consider playback history to provide a more accurate estimate of the audio aura.
